When a person is active on their telecommunications device (like a smartphone) the cell tower is logged. Cell towers have known position, and as such the movements of telecommunication users can be recorded at large scale. The visualization below plots the aggregated movements of ~97%* of the Danish population, through a span of time that covers the 2020 coronavirus lockdown period and more.
