# **How new corona cases impact travel**

{{< fontsize 14 >}}*Post by [Ulf Aslak](mailto:ulfaslak@gmail.com). Published: Aug, 13, 2020.*{{< /fontsize >}}

There have been two recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in Denmark; one in Aarhus and another in Ringsted. They started around the same time, approximately on July 28. Both are highly local, one among workers at a butchery and another among visitors to a Somali cultural center. We call these "superspreading events", and they are entirely expected based on how we understand viruses spread when very few people are infected.

Both spreading events have received a large amount of media attention, and with case numbers going up on the affected regions new lockdown restrictions are being advertised by government and local mayors. As we learned early on, lockdown has a huge effect on travel patterns. And though they have been advertised, no serious restrictions have been imposed yet. Any sign of behavioral change will therefore have to be due to people's personal choise to move around less.

In this blog post we investigate what impact new corona cases and renewed media attention have on travel. 

The first media mention of new corona cases [occured on July 29](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/stor-stigning-i-antallet-af-smittede-paa-dansk-slagteri) in connection to the Ringsted outbreak. Later on August 3, [a soccer win celebration in Århus](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/det-er-nok-en-supersprednings-begivenhed-smittetal-i-aarhus-mangedoblet-over) was connected to rapidly rising case numbers.

So let's first review the numbers. The figure below shows the relative change in case numbers since July 28, for the 10 most affected municipalities.

{{< figure src="/change_in_infected.png" caption="***Relative case number increase since July 28*** *in the 10 most affected municipalities. Shaded regions indicate new cases since last reading. Århus and Ringsted, where initial superspreading occured, stand apart but also neighboring municipalities like Silkeborg and Sorø see a large rise in case numbers.*">}}

Since almost all media attention has been on Århus and Ringsted, this figure is somewhat reassuring. **Århus and Ringsted visibly stand apart in case numbers.**

Now let us look at how mobility is impacted in the affected municipalities. The plot below visualizes the deviation in how much the average person travels in Århus and Ringsted, as well as Copenhagen as a reference. We observe that the trends diverge a lot after the weekend following July 28, meaning that people in Århus and Ringsted self-restrict travel more than in Copenhagen.
