Outside of Sweden *Midsommar* might be known as a horror movie of the same name and event, but in reality it is not as sinister.
In Sweden it is a public holiday where families get together to celebrate the summer solstice and everyone is enjoying a public day off.

In this post we explore how such a public holiday impacts the mobility and interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Looking at the change in population distributions across Sweden big spikes are being seen on the day of Midsommar in Sweden. 

*Change in population (relative)*

People are leaving the big cities like Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö and traveling to the countryside, especially vacation areas like Borgholm, 
Sotenäs, and Tanum. To give some perspective then ~200.000 people left Stockholm on this given day. It seems like this date marks the beginning of the summer due to the steady increase of population numbers 
in the countryside since then.

The pattern is very clear when looking at just the locations mentioned above as shown in the figure below. 
The 3 countryside locations have an increase between 140% and 260%. Stockholm and Göteborg sees a decrease of 30% and 20% respectively, 
where Malmö just sees a decrease of 5%. **(Kommenter på hvorfor dette kunne være)**.

*Share of population relocated*

When investigating the percentage of people that relocated on this given day in all of Sweden, we see that around 10.9% 
of the population relocated. On the previous and next friday only 3.3% and 5.2% respectively relocated, so more than a doubling
of people are moving. It is not unthinkable that a portion of relocations happened thursday evening and unsurprisingly 
5.4% of the population relocated on the previous day compared to the previous and next thursday, which respectively has 
2.6% and 4.6%.

Looking at movements between regions, see figure below, all we see is that people are not being very mobile relative to the previous Friday. 
This is likely a consequence of midsommar being a full day event, where the movement plot explores the differences between 
the most visited location during working hours and in the evening. Hence on this day people travels during the early hours and then 
stay stationary throughout the remainder of the day.
