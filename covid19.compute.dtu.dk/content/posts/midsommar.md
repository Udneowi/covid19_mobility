Outside of Sweden *Midsummer* might be known as a horror movie of the same name and event, but in reality it is not as sinister.
In Sweden it is a public holiday where families get together to celebrate the summer solstice, with traditional food, games and dancing.

In this post we explore how this public holiday impacted the mobility and interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Looking at the change in population distributions across Sweden, big spikes are being seen on the day of Midsummer, 19. of June, in Sweden. 

*Change in population (relative)*

People are leaving the big cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg (Göteborg) and Malmö and traveling to the countryside, especially vacation areas like Borgholm, 
Sotenäs, and Tanum. To give some perspective: ~200.000 people left Stockholm on this given day. Sweden previously recommended that all travels longer 
than 2 hours (by car) should be avoided, but that recommendation was lifted 4 days [prior](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/fragor-och-svar/?fbclid=IwAR1tjvvqaxj8JllJXR4oiH6aYy9j8Utag_bfd_akuwcWmYoHb_1AnjcLv3o) to Midsummer. 
This date is clearly marked in the data as the first individuals starts daring trips across country. Since then a steady increase of population numbers in the countryside can be seen.

The pattern is very clear when looking at just the locations mentioned above as shown in the figure below. 
The three countryside locations have an increase between 140% and 260%. Stockholm and Göteborg sees a decrease of 30% and 20% respectively, 
where Malmö just sees a decrease of 5%. This low decrease in Malmö could be due to the high diversity of cultures within the city since other traditions
might be at play. Around 34.4% of the population are [foreign born](http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101Q/UtlSvBakgFin/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=86abd797-7854-4564-9150-c9b06ae3ab07c9b06ae3ab07),
in Malmö compared to 24.4% in Stockholm. However the real reason is out of scope for this post.


*Share of population relocated*

When investigating the percentage of people that relocated on this given day in all of Sweden, we see that around 10.9% 
of the population relocated. On the previous and next friday only 3.3% and 5.2% respectively relocated, so more than a doubling
of people are moving. It is not unthinkable that a portion of relocations happened thursday evening which is confirmed by the 
5.4% of the population relocated on the previous day compared to the previous and next thursday, which respectively has 
2.6% and 4.6%.

Looking at movements between regions (see figure below) all we see is that people are not being very mobile relative to the previous Friday. 
This is likely a consequence of midsummer being a full day event, where the movement plot explores the differences between 
the most visited location during working hours and in the evening. Hence on this day people travels during the early hours and then 
stay stationary throughout the remainder of the day.

We can use our interactive visualizations to closely inspect the travel behavior of populations both over time but also on specific dates. 
Here, we can observe that a massive relocation within the Swedish population occurs on a single date. 
Events like these are important to understanding both the state of an economy through the lens of travel, but also because they increase 
the risk of population mixing and, therefore, increased disease spreading between regions.
